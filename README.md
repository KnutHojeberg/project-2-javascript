This website was designed to let people play the famous game "Rock, paper, scissors". The webside is one site which gives the user three diffrent options as "weapons", rock, paper and scissors. The user gets to choose one of the three options then the computer chooses one and the out come is displayed in the "results" section and the score is updated on the score board.

The page lets the user start playing the game right away. The page contains a header with the name of the game, "Rock, paper, scissors" and then three options with pairing pictures which is "Rock, paper, scissors". Above the three choices is an scoreboard which keeps count of the score to create a more competetive experience while playing the game. Below the three choices is a results bar which displays the outcome of the last played round. Lastly at the bottom is a short description of the rules. 

This website is the second of five projects that must be completed to earn a Diploma in Software Development from The Code Institute.

Requirements for the project are that the website must be static and responsive with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. A live version of the site can be found here: https://knuthojeberg.github.io/project-2-javascript/
