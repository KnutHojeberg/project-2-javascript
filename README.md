This website was designed to let people play the famous game "Rock, paper, scissors". The webside is one site which gives the user three diffrent options as "weapons", rock, paper and scissors. The user gets to choose one of the three options then the computer chooses one and the out come is displayed in the "results" section and the score is updated on the score board.

The page lets the user start playing the game right away. The page contains a header with the name of the game, "Rock, paper, scissors" and then three options with pairing pictures which is "Rock, paper, scissors". Above the three choices is an scoreboard which keeps count of the score to create a more competetive experience while playing the game. Below the three choices is a results bar which displays the outcome of the last played round. Lastly at the bottom is a short description of the rules. 

This website is the second of five projects that must be completed to earn a Diploma in Software Development from The Code Institute.

Requirements for the project are that the website must be static and responsive with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. A live version of the site can be found here: https://knuthojeberg.github.io/project-2-javascript/

Design
The background color was choosed to be an calming and playful color due to the demograhpic of the game. This came out to be a dark green color.
The website used for this was https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_palettes.asp
<img width="650" alt="" src="assets/images/color-palette.png">

This website is two pages, Index.html contains a button stating "Start Quiz", which when clicked will take you to the quiz page: quiz.html. The second link is under the quiz page header with "Go back", which will take you back to the start quiz on the home page.

Colour Scheme
I have chosen the color scale that I have on the website by uploading the image that is doglogo-image-section on the quiz.html page to colors and there created a palette that matches that image.

I created the palette because I wanted to get an impression of a whole with a soft feel. The colors are a mixture of dark and light in the same tone, which makes it restful for the eyes.

Got an error when I checked with the console, that javascript was loaded incorrectly.
Solution: removed javascript from index.html page.
